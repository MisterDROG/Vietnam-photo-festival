            <p class="intro__subtitle">While competition for visitors is stiff in Southeast Asia, the best things to do in Vietnam truly offer something for everyone. From idyllic sun-soaked beaches and vertiginous mountains to hyperactive cities and characterful rural towns, the country hosts numerous alluring destinations. Getting around is easy and affordable, as flights connect the most popular spots, while buses and trains link the rest. However, the motorbike is king here, and those willing to jump on two wheels will be spoiled for choice of where to go and what to see. As you explore this gorgeous country, you’ll also be treated to some of the most delicious and diverse cuisine around. Northern, central and southern Vietnam are each home to their own distinct gastronomic traditions, and even certain cities within these regions have their own local specialities.</p>

                    <p class="plgrid__paragraph">In the very north of Vietnam, along its mountainous border with China, is the provincial capital, Ha Giang. The round-trip Ha Giang Loop that leads from here offers views of prominent peaks, sharp cliff faces, gorges and fertile valleys along narrow, winding roads.</p>
                    <p class="plgrid__paragraph">Doing the full loop of Vietnam's most popular motorcycle route takes at least three days, five if you want to explore the additional turns between villages along the way. One thing to note, however, is that the roads are in poor condition, so the driving experience is essential.</p>

                    <p class="plgrid__paragraph">Vietnam's capital is also its transportation hub: No matter what day it is, there are guaranteed to be mopeds clogging the city's boulevards. However, at the center of Hanoi, the narrow market alleys and old merchants' houses are clear of traffic as well as charming.</p>
                    <p class="plgrid__paragraph">All across the 1,000-year-old city, chaos and tranquillity, modern lifestyles and ancestral traditions exist side-by-side. Temples and historic buildings are as much a part of Hanoi as fancy hotels, glass office towers and numerous museums dedicated to Vietnam's history.</p>

However, no trip would be complete without heading out to sea, preferably by kayak, to marvel at the karsts – and maybe even see a dolphin.</p>
                    <p class="plgrid__paragraph">Easily accessible from Hanoi, the island is a protected nature park that is home to several rare animal species, as well as offers excellent trekking opportunities to climbers from all over the world.</p>

                    <p class="plgrid__paragraph">The former imperial city of Hue is nestled on the banks of the Perfume River. In the 19th century, it was the political, religious and cultural center of Vietnam – something its temples, pagodas and nearby imperial tombs, each with its own character, can attest to.</p>
                    <p class="plgrid__paragraph">In the middle of Hue is a sprawling citadel where the Purple Forbidden City can be found – the place reserved only for the emperor and his concubines. It was here where the last emperor handed over power to Ho Chi Minh and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in 1945.</p>
