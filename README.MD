The site is dedicated to photography and travel in Vietnam.

This site is designed as a portfolio. It demonstrates the use of such tools as:

- Grid and flex layout
- Adaptive website (4 widths: 320px, 720px, 1024px, 1280px)
- Applying media queries
- Elastic layout (looks good on all resolutions)
- Connecting non-standard fonts

As a site development, it is planned to use a BEM nested file structure (at the moment, BEM is used only for classes) and adding a language switch to Vietnamese in the header of the site.

Website was developed by Igor Drogaitsev.
